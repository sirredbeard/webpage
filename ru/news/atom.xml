&lt;p&gt;With another year behind us, let’s review the progress that the
Fortran-lang community has made.
If you’re new to Fortran-lang, here’s a quick intro:
We’re an open source community that aims to develop modern Fortran tooling and
nurture a rich ecosystem of libraries, as well as to provide a friendly,
helpful, and inclusive space for newcomers and experienced Fortran programmers
to work together.
We started in late 2019 and have been going ever since.
If you’re first discovering (or re-discovering) Fortran through this article,
welcome, and we hope it inspires you to try Fortran for one of your projects.
In this article we summarize new developments from 2021,
from flagship and new projects to community development and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

be the first result when you search «Fortran» in Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo,
Ecosia, Qwant, SearchEncrypt and the second result in Google (after the

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the website is to maintain a neutral place where any Fortran user

comprehensive and includes all major open source and commercial compilers.
